# What I'm Building

As a budget traveler, I often want to see all my accommodation options in one place. I'm not overly picky about where I stay, but I've spent so much time with 7 tabs open trying to search for somewhere that fits my budget and needs at the time. I want to make it easier to see all your options in one place with your budget, so I'm developing a small, simple app that pulls data from popular hotel and rental booking sites like Booking.com, Airbnb, and HostelWorld so that you can see more options all in one place.

# How I'm Building

Many of these websites do not have a public API that can be used, so I'm building web scrapers using Cheerio to build the APIs with the data that I need. I'm using React on the frontend and Node with Express on the backend.

# This is a work in progress

Please keep in mind that if you're seeing this code, it is a work in progress! I will be updating this project consistently, so feel free to keep up!
