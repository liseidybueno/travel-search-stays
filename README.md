# What I'm Building

As a budget traveler, I often want to see all my accommodation options in one place. I'm not overly picky about where I stay, but I've spent so much time with 7 tabs open trying to search for somewhere that fits my budget and needs at the time. I want to make it easier to see all your options in one place with your budget, so I'm developing a small, simple app that pulls data from popular hotel and rental booking sites like Booking.com and Airbnb so that you can see more options all in one place.

# How I'm Building

I'm using Node.js and Express on the backend with React on the frontend. I've used RapidAPI for an API that collects data from AirBnB and created a custom API for Booking.com data via webscraping with Cheerio. I decided to create an API for the Booking.com Data because I wasn't able to find an API that easily returned the data I needed using the query parameters I required.

## TOOLS, FRAMEWORKS, & LANGUAGES USED:

- JavaScript
- Node.js & Express
- React
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Postman

# This is a work in progress

Please keep in mind that this is currently a work in progress! I will be updating this project consistently, so feel free to keep up!

## Future Plans:

- Add ratings
- Add queries: number of people
- Add filters: accommodation type (hotels, hostels, airbnbs), rating, and source
- Add sort by price
- Add sort by rating
- Add user registration and allow users to save listings
